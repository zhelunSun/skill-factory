# Skill Factory

> **"The first industrial revolution ended when machines began building machines."**
> **Skill Factory is the machine that builds skills.**

A **meta-skill** for OpenClaw that automates the full lifecycle of skill creation — from a fuzzy idea to a polished, versioned, distributable package.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Creating an OpenClaw skill without a workflow leads to: fuzzy specs, missed knowledge during distillation, scattered files impossible to publish, and skills that stagnate at v1.0 with no clear upgrade path.

**Skill Factory solves all of this** by treating skill creation as a repeatable, improvable process — not a one-off creative act.

## What Makes It Different?

Most skill-making is ad hoc. Skill Factory is an **end-to-end automated SOP** that any Claw instance can follow:

**Foundation** — lock scope before work begins:
- **Phase 0 three-question lock** — prevents scope creep and over-engineering

**Quality** — ensure nothing is missed:
- **Mandatory source re-verification** — catches missed content after distillation

**Structure** — ship-ready from day one:
- **Independent repo per skill** — every skill is GitHub/ClawHub-ready from day one
- **Semantic versioning for skills** — clear rules for MAJOR vs MINOR vs PATCH

**Evolution** — not just 0→1, but 1→N:
- **Human-AI collaborative iteration** — ongoing improvement with versioned upgrades

It is not about what Claw *can* do — it is about turning an unbounded capability into a **reliable, high-quality pipeline**. The process is the product.

---

## Quick Start

Just send Claw an idea:

```
New skill: [name], [1-2 sentences], [source URL (optional)]
```

Claw enters **Phase 0** immediately — no setup required.

---

## Example: Building the `harness` Skill

Here is how Skill Factory handled a real request end-to-end:

**Input** (30 seconds):
```
New skill: harness, distill OpenAI's agent engineering article,
https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/
```

**Phase 0** — Three questions answered in one message:
- Target: any Claw working on agent-first engineering
- Source: OpenAI Harness Engineering blog post
- Scope: GitHub + local workspace

**Phase 1** — `web_fetch` the source, saved to `wip/harness/raw/`

**Phase 2** — Distilled into `SKILL.md` (10 principles) + `references/` (two documents). Mandatory re-read caught 4 missed concepts including the "Ralph Wiggum loop".

**Phase 3** — Independent repo, MIT license, bilingual README, git-tagged `v1.2.0`, synced to workspace.

**Total time**: ~10 minutes. Without the factory, the same work took a full day of iteration and still had gaps.

---

## Four-Phase SOP Overview

| Phase | Name | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| 0 | Capture | `BRIEF.md` — locked spec |
| 1 | Collect | `raw/` — raw source material |
| 2 | Distill | `SKILL.md` + `references/` |
| 3 | Publish | versioned repo, synced to workspace |

Full SOP details are in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

---

## Version Management

Skills use **Semantic Versioning** adapted for this format:

| Bump | When |
|------|------|
| `PATCH` (x.x.1) | Typo fix, trigger word tweak |
| `MINOR` (x.1.0) | New source, new section, extended triggers |
| `MAJOR` (2.0.0) | Paradigm shift, structural refactor |

**MAJOR does not mean more content** — a skill that doubles its references but keeps the same structure is still MINOR.

## Installation

### From ClawHub (Recommended)

```bash
claw skill install skillfactory
```

Or use the full identifier:

```bash
claw skill install github.com/PandaBro666/skillfactory
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repo to your skills directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PandaBro666/skillfactory.git ~/.workbuddy/skills/skillfactory
```

2. Restart your Claw session — the skill will auto-load.
