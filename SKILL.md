# Skill Factory — The Meta-Skill for Making Skills

> "The first industrial revolution was marked by using machines to make machines.
> Skill Factory is the machine that makes skills."

## Purpose

Skill Factory provides a **repeatable, human-AI collaborative SOP** for going from a raw idea to a polished, publishable OpenClaw skill. It handles:

- **0→1**: Rapid capture of fuzzy ideas → structured BRIEF → distilled skill
- **1→N**: Iterating an existing skill with new sources or structural improvements
- **N→∞**: Publishing, versioning, ClawHub distribution, and ongoing maintenance

The key insight: **this is not about capability, it's about workflow.** Any Claw instance with this skill loaded can build production-quality skills — the process is the product.

---

## How to Trigger This Skill

Just say something like:

> `New skill: [name], [1-2 sentences], [source URL (optional)]`
> `Upgrade skill: [skill name/path], [change request], [new source URL (optional)]`

### New skill examples:
- `New skill: prompt-engineering, best practices from Anthropic and OpenAI`
- `New skill: git-workflow, standardize my branching and PR flow, https://...`
- `新 skill：简历筛选，用关键词匹配和语义分析筛选简历`

### Upgrade skill examples:
- `Upgrade skill: nova-reader, add Semantic Scholar data source`
- `Upgrade skill: harness, strengthen governance rules from Phase 3.5 lessons`
- `升级 skill：skill-factory，增加显式升级模式`

Claw will enter **Phase 0** for new skills or the **Upgrade Workflow** for existing skills — no more information needed to start.

**中文用户**: `新 skill：[名字]，[1-2句说明]，[来源URL（可选）]` for new; `升级 skill：[skill名字/路径]，[变更要求]，[新来源URL（可选）]` for upgrades.

---

## Four-Phase SOP

### Phase 0 · Capture（≤5 min）

**Goal**: Lock down the spec before any work begins.

1. Save raw idea to `inbox/<skill-name>.md` (防止遗失)
2. Ask exactly **3 questions** — no more:
   - What is the target scenario / user?
   - Are there reference sources? (If not, Claw will search)
   - Publish scope: local-only / GitHub / ClawHub distribution?
3. Generate `wip/<skill-name>/BRIEF.md`

**Key principle**: Phase 0 prevents over-engineering (LRN-003). Don't start building until the 3 questions are answered.

---

### Phase 1 · Collect（automated）

**Goal**: Gather raw material without processing.

1. `web_fetch` each source → save to `wip/<skill-name>/raw/`
2. If no sources provided, `web_search` for 2–3 high-quality references
3. Prioritize: official docs > primary blog posts > secondary analysis

**Rule**: At least 1 first-party source (official docs / original author's post). Raw content is saved as-is — no processing yet.

---

### Phase 2 · Distill（core work）

**Goal**: Extract signal, discard noise.

1. Read all `raw/` files
2. Write per skill-creator spec:
   - `SKILL.md` — triggers + workflow (≤200 lines)
   - `references/` — detailed knowledge, split by topic
   - `scripts/` — reusable code, only if needed
3. **Mandatory verification** (LRN-001): Re-fetch original source, diff against draft, check for gaps

**Quality checklist**:
- [ ] Trigger words are broad enough to cover all user phrasings
- [ ] SKILL.md has a clear "when to use" section
- [ ] Detail lives in `references/`, not bloating `SKILL.md`
- [ ] At least one mandatory re-read of primary source after distillation

---

### Phase 3 · Publish

**Goal**: Clean, versioned, standalone repo ready for GitHub/ClawHub.

#### Repo Structure (Minimal)

```
<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md          # Entry point (triggers + workflow)
├── README.md         # Human-facing intro — bilingual (EN + ZH)
├── CHANGELOG.md      # Version history
├── LICENSE           # MIT recommended
├── .gitignore
└── references/       # Knowledge base
    └── *.md
```

For script-heavy skills, add:
```
└── scripts/
    └── *.py
```

#### README Spec

A skill README must answer 3 questions in ≤60 seconds of reading:
1. **What problem does it solve?** (1-2 sentences, no jargon)
2. **What makes it better than asking without it?** (key differentiator)
3. **How do I use it?** (one concrete example)

**Bilingual (EN + ZH)**: Use two separate files for maximum clarity.

```
README.md       # English only — no Chinese text anywhere
README_zh.md    # Chinese only — full detail, selling points, usage
```

Each file includes a badge linking to the other version. This allows GitHub to render clean language-specific views and enables future ClawHub to surface the right version per locale.

#### ClawHub Distribution

When the user wants to publish to ClawHub:
1. Ensure `SKILL.md` frontmatter has: `name`, `version`, `description`
2. `description` must contain broad trigger phrases covering multiple phrasings
3. `LICENSE` file present (MIT recommended)
4. Tag the release: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`

#### Sync to Local Workspace

After publishing, sync to `~/.workbuddy/skills/<skill-name>/` so Claw can use it immediately:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "D:\Agent\WorkBuddy\skills\<skill-name>\*" "$env:USERPROFILE\.workbuddy\skills\<skill-name>\"
```

## Upgrade Workflow (1→N Maintenance)

**Goal**: Update an existing skill without starting from scratch.

This is a **first-class workflow**, distinct from creating a new skill. When the user invokes `Upgrade skill:`, follow these steps:

### Step 1 · Inspect (read existing state)

1. Read the existing skill repo:
   - `SKILL.md` — current version, triggers, workflow
   - `CHANGELOG.md` — version history (especially recent entries)
   - `README.md` — public description
   - `references/` — existing knowledge base
   - Git log — recent changes and commit history
2. Identify the current version (from `SKILL.md` frontmatter or git tag)

### Step 2 · Classify the change

Compare the requested change against the skill's **public API** — its documented behavior:

| Public API element | Examples |
|-------------------|----------|
| Use cases | What scenarios the skill serves |
| Input format | What the user says to trigger the skill |
| Output format | What files/code the skill produces |
| Workflow phases | The SOP structure |
| Safety boundaries | What the agent must not do |
| File structure | Repo layout conventions |
| Publishing behavior | How the skill is distributed |

Determine the version bump:

| Bump | When | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| **PATCH** `x.x.1` | Fixes that don't change behavior | Typo fix, clarification, trigger word tweak |
| **MINOR** `x.1.0` | Backward-compatible additions | New workflow mode, new reference source, optional publishing path |
| **MAJOR** `x.0.0` | Breaking changes | Changed triggering format, restructured SOP, removed phase, changed safety assumptions |

### Step 3 · Propose (generate upgrade plan)

Before making any changes, produce an upgrade plan:

```markdown
## Upgrade Plan

Current version: <version from SKILL.md>
Proposed version: <computed bump>
Change type: PATCH / MINOR / MAJOR

Reason:
<why this change belongs in this category>

Files to modify:
<list of files that need changes>

Risk level: low / medium / high
Backward compatibility: yes / no

Proposed changelog entry:
### Added
- <new features>

### Changed
- <behavior changes>

### Fixed
- <bug fixes>

Suggested commit message:
<semantic commit message>

Suggested tag:
v<new version>
```

Present this plan to the user. Do not apply changes until the user confirms.

### Step 4 · Apply

After user confirmation:

1. Update files (SKILL.md, README, CHANGELOG, references)
2. Bump version in SKILL.md frontmatter and README badges
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with proper format (see below)
4. Commit with semantic message
5. Tag the release: `git tag v<new-version> && git push --tags`
6. Re-sync to local workspace

### Step 5 · Upgrade Summary

After applying, produce a summary:

```
## Upgrade Complete

<old version> → <new version>
Files changed: <list>
Changelog: <link or excerpt>
Next steps: <optional>
```

---

## Version Management

Version semantics follow **Semantic Versioning** adapted for skills:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

| Version bump | When | Example trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **PATCH** `x.x.1` | Typo fix, trigger word tweak, minor clarification | "修复了一个例子描述不准" |
| **MINOR** `x.1.0` | New reference source, new phase step, extended trigger coverage | "加入 Anthropic 最新文档" |
| **MAJOR** `2.0.0` | Scope change, structural refactor, paradigm shift | "从单文档改为多 reference 结构" |

### What warrants a MAJOR bump?

A MAJOR version (e.g. 1.x → 2.0) signals a **breaking change in the skill's mental model**:
- The core SOP phases are restructured
- The skill's scope is fundamentally redefined
- Files are reorganized in ways that break the previous structure
- The activation paradigm changes (e.g. from "ask anything" to "four-phase SOP")

**MAJOR ≠ more content**. A skill that doubles its references but keeps the same structure is still a MINOR bump.

### What warrants a MINOR bump?

A MINOR version (e.g. 1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2) signals **additive improvements** that don't break the existing pattern:
- New knowledge source added to `references/`
- New trigger words added to frontmatter
- New section added to SOP without restructuring existing phases
- README improvements, badge updates

### Commit message convention

```
feat: add [source] to references        → MINOR
fix: correct [description]              → PATCH
refactor: restructure [component]       → could be MAJOR
release: v2.0.0 - [summary]            → tag release commits
```

### Changelog discipline

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

Every release must update `CHANGELOG.md` with:
- `[Unreleased]` section at the top (collects next-version changes)
- Version section for each release: `[X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`
- Grouped changes under: **Added**, **Changed**, **Fixed**, **Deprecated**, **Removed**, **Security**
- User-readable summaries, not raw git diffs
- A single-line **Summary** at the top of each version

The `[Unreleased]` section captures changes that will go into the next release. Before cutting a new version, review `[Unreleased]`, classify entries, and move them into the version section.

**Distinction**: git history = developer log; CHANGELOG = user-facing narrative. Do not substitute one for the other.

---

## Skill Iteration (Legacy — use Upgrade Workflow above)

The legacy iteration path is preserved for quick edits. For structured upgrades, use the **Upgrade Workflow** (produces planned changes and version bump).

When doing a quick upgrade:

1. Create a new branch or directly update `D:/Agent/WorkBuddy/skills/<skill-name>/`
2. Add new source to `references/` with dated filename (`source-YYYYMMDD.md`)
3. Update `SKILL.md` version field and trigger words if needed
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
5. Bump version (MAJOR / MINOR / PATCH per rules above)
6. Commit with semantic message
7. Re-sync to local workspace

**Upgrade triggers**: User sends new URL, user says "skill has a gap", Claw detects missing knowledge during a task execution.
